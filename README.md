# nodetifications

Notifications made easy in NodeJS!

## Features
- Very (c)lean package! < 4kB zipped and < 8kB unzipped, and documented with JSDoc annotations.
- Multiple providers and notification modes in 1 package.
- Very lean dependency, which means less points of failure.
- Highly flexible to your needs, change provider/creds anywhere in between.
- Standardized response formats. All successful requests will return JSON responses.
- Promise based for asynchronous support and no [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/).
